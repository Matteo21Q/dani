Description: Provides tools to help with the design and analysis of non-inferiority trials. These include functions for doing sample size 
 calculations and for analysing non-inferiority trials, using a variety of outcome types and population-level sumamry measures. It also features 
 functions to make trials more resilient by using the concept of non-inferiority frontiers, as described in Quartagno et al. (2019) <arXiv:1905.00241>. 
 Finally it includes function to design and analyse MAMS-ROCI (aka DURATIONS) trials.
